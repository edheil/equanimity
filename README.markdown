# Equanimity

...is a personal life tracker, for tracking anything in your life that can be quantified with a floating point number and a tag.  It is a work in progress.

It uses _whytheluckystiff's [Camping](http://camping.rubyforge.org/) framework, which has been picked up and is still in development, offering its own unique advantages despite the success of similar works like Sinatra.
 
It was developed to be deployed on [heroku](http://heroku.com/) for personal use only, and does not yet have any authentication or login mechanism.
