* Equanimity

...is a personal life tracker, for tracking anything in your life that
can be qu antified with a floating point number and a tag.  It is a
work in progress.

It uses _whytheluckystiff's [[http://camping.rubyforge.org/][Camping]] framework.
 
It was developed to be deployed on [[http://heroku.com/][Heroku]] for my personal use only,
but has finally had an extremely simplistic user authentication
mechanism added as of Mar 2011, so it could be used by multiple
users.

It is still butt ugly, but seems to work ridiculously well as far as
quick, streamlined ease of use for me personally.
